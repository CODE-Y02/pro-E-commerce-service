# pro-ecomm-graphql

This is NOT JUST PROJECT but an Professional and Scable backend

## BACKEND Stack

- Node JS
- Express
- Graphql + REST - REST will be need for webhook and payment stuff.
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- (upcoming) Docker & Redis - This I will add at end of project.
- (upcoming) some best pratices like structured response, centralized error handling, etc.
- Why Not TS: I can but when I am validating data on graphql level then why use TS also I realized too late that I can use TS here my models were ready at that time.
- I may probably never host it with redis and buch of stuff as it cost $$ to host such a server.

## WEB Client : IMS ( Inventory Management System )

- React JS - its just a dashboard dont ask me why use react now pls.
- Recoil JS - Its a redux alternative by meta & its much simpler.
- React Router
- I have decided to reduce complexity of dashboard it wont look good now

## NATIVE Client: Main Ecomm Client ( Upcoming)

- Expo - No alternative of this its best if we want cross platform app based on react

- In This project I wont be using TS as its already very complex project.
- Why I am making this ???
  - I want to make a one really good backend as I have many of such projects planned but in web 3 I realized that once this one is ready I can direactly copy paste most of the stuffs.
- What Happen To webRTC project.
  - That One is still in progress I first want to build this one and than some few projects on web 3 & rust maybe.
